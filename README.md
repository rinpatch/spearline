# Spearline  - Piercing Bias. Truth in the Line.

![spearline logo](./public/spearline-logo.png)

Spearline is an AI-powered Malaysian news aggregator designed to uncover media bias.

We bring together news from across languages â€” Malay, English, and Chinese â€” and use AI to summarize each article and identify its ideological leanings, such as Pro-Government, Pro-Islam, or Opposition-aligned.

## Team
This project is done by Nott-A-Hackers team for Taylor's Univeristy ImagineHack 2025 Hackathon. The team members are:
- [@rinpatch](https://github.com/rinpatch)

## Technologies Used
- Next.js (FE/BE)
- Vercel (Deploy)
- Supabase (Postgres Database to store articles/embeddings)
- Qstash (Job queue for news scraping/processing)
- Upstash Redis (In-Memory cache, we just use it to keep track of recently processed articles to not reprocess them)
- Openrouter (Unified LLM API allowing for easy switching of models, we currently use gemini-2.0-flash for everything due to good cost-to-benefit)
- OpenAI embeddings API (used to transform news text into number vectors, which we can compare for similarity in order to "cluster" articles about same topic into one story)

## Deploying

Deploy in a [Vercel](https://vercel.com) project with QStash, Supabase and Upstash Redis connected. Set the following evironment variables:
- `APP_BASE_URL`: prod url that QStash cron will query (i.e https://spearline.vercel.app/).
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: OpenRouter API key to be used for analysis as well as summary/title generation.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key, will only be used for text embeddings.

## Challenge and Approach

### Problem
Malaysia's news media is deeply fragmented along ethnic, linguistic, and political lines. A single news story can be interpreted in completely different ways depending on whether the reader views it in Malay, Chinese, or English â€” and from which outlet.

### Our Approach
Spearline tackles this problem by using AI to detect and visualize ideological bias in news articles across multiple Malaysian media sources. We built an aggregator platform that:
- Collects news articles from different language-based sources
- Uses an LLM (via OpenRouter) to summarize articles and classify bias (e.g., Pro-Government, Pro-Opposition, Pro-Malay, etc.)
- Displays these biases in a clean, percentage-based breakdown per article
- Offers users different perspectives side by side, helping them see beyond their media bubble

**The goal**: Make media bias transparent, and empower Malaysians to think critically about what they read.

## âœ¨ Features
- **AI-Powered Bias Detection**: Uses advanced LLM technology to classify ideological leanings
- **Visual Bias Breakdown**: Clean percentage-based visualization of detected biases
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Compare different perspectives on the same story
- **Real-time Analysis**: Live processing of news articles as they're published
